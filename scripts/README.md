## Scripts

This folder contains bash scripts to install various packages on Ubuntu 16.04. Some of these packages are useful for optimization, ROS related libraries, but mostly for different interfaces (kinect, audio, openpose, etc.). By default, the various interfaces are not enabled in pyrobolearn.
