"""Define the OpenAI Gym State

This defines the OpenAI Gym state such that it is compatible with the pyrobolearn framework. It notably decouples
loosely the states from the gym environment. Specifically, the `GymState` allows to extract the shape of the state
from the gym environment, and keep it as an attribute of the class. This can then be used by other classes such as
the various policies defined in the pyrobolearn framework.
