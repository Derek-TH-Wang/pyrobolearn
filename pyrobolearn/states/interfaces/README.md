## Interface states

This folder contains the states that get the information from interfaces defined in `pyrobolearn.tools.interfaces`; these include joystick / game controllers, cameras (such as webcams, kinect, etc), and others. To demonstrate its usefulness, let's consider a state that reads the joystick position, and let's assume we want to train a policy that receives as input that state, and outputs an action to move the wheels of a robot. In the training mode, the joystick state can generate deterministically or randomly (based on a probability distribution such as :math:`s_t \sim p(.)`, or :math:`s_{t+1} = s_t + \epsilon` with :math:`\epsilon \sim p(.)`), a joystick position that will be given to the policy. Note that the state is also provided to the reward function which can account on how to compute the reward value based on, for instance, the joystick position state and the robot base position state. In the test phase, the joystick state returns the position read from the joystick interface.
