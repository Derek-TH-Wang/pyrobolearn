## Learning Tasks / paradigms

This folder contains learning tasks/paradigms and how they should be run. These include:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: the task accepts as inputs the environment and the policies. This can then be given to a RL algorithm.
- Imitation learning (IL) tasks: the task accepts as inputs the environment, the policies, and the bridges to the interface used to interact with a part of the simulator (robot, object in the world, etc).

Other learning paradigms include (but are not implemented yet):
- Active learning (AL)
- Curriculum learning (CL)
- Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
- Transfer learning (TL)
- Hierarchical learning (HL)
- Online learning (OL)
- Lifelong (or continual) learning (LL)
- Multi-task learning (MTL)
- Meta-learning (ML)


Each task/paradigm can be evaluated using different metrics.


## TODO

- [ ] maybe I should change the name of the folder to `paradigms` instead of `tasks` to avoid the confusion with robotic tasks (used for instance in the stack of tasks).
- [ ] implement the other paradigms
