## Learning Tasks

This folder contains learning tasks and how they should be run. These include:
- Reinforcement learning tasks: the task accepts as inputs the environment and the policies. This can then be given to a RL algorithm.
- Imitation learning tasks: the task accepts as inputs the environment, the policies, and the bridges to the interface used to interact with a part of the simulator (robot, object in the world, etc).

Other learning paradigms include (but are not implemented yet):
- Active learning
- Curriculum learning
- Inverse reinforcement learning
- Transfer learning

Each task can be evaluated using different metrics.
