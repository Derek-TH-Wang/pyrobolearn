Plotting Tools
==============

Plotting tools are extremely important in research. For this purpose, we plan to provide plotting tools that allows to
plot in real-time different quantities that can be observed in the simulator, like the joint states, the position and
orientation of each body in the world by plotting their reference frame, the position and orientation of links of a
specific body, the resulting trajectories in the 3D Cartesian space, etc.

Warnings: THIS IS CURRENTLY AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE.
