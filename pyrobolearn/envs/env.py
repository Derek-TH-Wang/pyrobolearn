class Env(object):  # gym.Env):  # TODO: make it inheriting the gym.Env
    r"""Environment class.

    This class defines the environment as it described in a reinforcement learning setting [1]. That is, given an
    action :math:`a_t` performed by an agent (i.e. policy), the environment computes and returns the next state
    :math:`s_{t+1}` and reward :math:`r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})`. A policy can then interact with this environment,
    and be trained.

    The environment defines the world, the rewards, and the states that are returned by it.
    To allow our framework to be generic and modular, the world, rewards, and states are decoupled from the environment,
    and can be defined outside of this one and then provided as inputs to the `Env` class. That is, we favor
    'composition over inheritance' (see [2]). This is a different approach compared to what is usually done using
    the OpenAI gym framework (see [3]). That said, in order to be compatible with this framework, we inherit from
    the `gym.Env` class (see `core.py` in `https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/core.py`).
