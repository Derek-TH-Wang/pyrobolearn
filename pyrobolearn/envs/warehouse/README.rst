Warehouse Environments
======================

WARNING: This is currently a work in progress. The rewards and other functions have not been defined yet.

This folder contains environments where robots have to move objects from one place to another.
This can be carried out by transporting them from one place to another, or picking them up from one place and dropping
them on another place.

An example of the former is to move a box from one room to another room using a wheeled robot. An example of the latter
is to pick up a box from one belt conveyor using a robot manipulator and drop it on another conveyor (which is close to
the first one).

Other environments consist:

- to pick up an object on a belt conveyor and rotate it to a desired rotation before dropping it on the same conveyor
- to pick up scattered objects and regroup them on a belt conveyor, or put them in a specific order / pattern
- to assemble objects together (see the peg-in-hole assembly problem)
