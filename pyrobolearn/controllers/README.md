## Controllers

THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Controllers are basically policies that do not possess any (hyper-)parameters to optimize. They are manually coded by the user.

Planning (TODO):
- [ ] add (kinematic and dynamic) whole body controllers
- [ ] add some finite state machines
- [ ] add some classical locomotion controllers (based on ZMP, optimization, etc)
