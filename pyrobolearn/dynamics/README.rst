Dynamic models
==============

Dynamic models are models that given the current state (or a history of states), and the current action compute the 
next state. If dynamic models are provided or trained, we are often in a model-based reinforcement learning (also 
known as optimal control) setting.

Warnings: Dynamic models have not been tested yet in the current framework. They will be added shortly to the 
framework.
