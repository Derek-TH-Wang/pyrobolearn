## Metrics

Different learning tasks use different metrics. For instance, in transfer learning other metrics are used to evaluate the task than in reinforcement learning.

This folder will contain in the future the various metrics. They should be able to collect various information, evaluate how well the learning task is performed, and plot the results.
By providing the different metrics, the user can select which metric he/she wants to use to evaluate his/her learning task.
