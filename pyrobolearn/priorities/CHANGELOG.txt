- Translated most C++ code from the `OpenSoT` library to Python
- made it a standalone library (does not depend on other libraries (or middleware layers) except numpy)
- Add more complete documentation for each class and method (this was seriously lacking in the original OpenSoT)
- Improve methods and made them more Pythonic
- Add few extra constraints and tasks (based on Songyan Xin's work)
- Integration with the PyRoboLearn framework through the robot model
