"""Define the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) learning model.

This file provides the VAE model; a parametric, generally non-linear, non-recurrent, generative, and stochastic model.
This model is a generative latent variable model which projects the input data into a latent lower
dimensional space through an encoder, and re-projects it to the original data space through the use of the decoder.

We decided to use the `pytorch` framework because of its popularity in the research community field, flexibility,
similarity with numpy (but with automatic differentiation: autograd), GPU capabilities, and more Pythonic approach.
While we thought about using other frameworks (such as Keras, Tensorflow, and others) as well, it would have
unnecessarily complexify the whole framework, as these frameworks would not only influence the learning models,
but also the losses, optimizers, and other modules. While we could have written some interfaces that makes the bridge
between these various frameworks and ours, we came to the conclusion that this would take a considerable amount of
efforts and time that we do not have for the moment.
