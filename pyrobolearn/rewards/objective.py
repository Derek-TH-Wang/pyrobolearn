# This file defines the main `Objective` class, which is inherited by the `Reward` and `Cost` classes, and
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# all subsequent child classes which define common objective/reward/cost functions.
# Objectives can be maximized or minimized, while rewards are maximized, and costs are minimized.
# Allow to define objectives with different frameworks: numpy, pytorch, tensorflow, theano,...
# That is, by giving the framework we want to use as input to the children of the `Objective` class,
# it will return the objective in the correct format. Thus we don't need to define various classes for each possible
# different frameworks.
#
# Some objectives needs to access the robot's and/or environment's information.
#
# Objectives can be added together using `+` and multiplied by a weight number using `*`
#
# To see the doc in python interpreter:
# from pyrobolearn.objectives.objective import Objective
# print(Objective.__doc__)
