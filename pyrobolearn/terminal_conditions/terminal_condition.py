    This class provides the basic layout for the `TerminalCondition` class and its child classes.
    This one can be used to check when an environment has fulfilled certain conditions and can be terminated.

    This class can be further subdivided into two categories: failed and succeeded conditions.
    * Failed conditions determine when a policy has failed to perform a certain task
    * Succeeded conditions determine when a policy has succeeded to perform a certain task

    In order to compute this condition, they can access to more information than the state provided to the agent(s).
