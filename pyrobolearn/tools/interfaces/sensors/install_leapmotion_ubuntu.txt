Installation of LeapMotion on Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
================================================

After downloading the "Desktop Setup" available here: https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop/

If you have an error during the Linux installation such as the following:

$ sudo dpkg --install Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb

Selecting previously unselected package leap.
(Reading database ... 478480 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb ...
Unpacking leap (2.3.1+31549) ...
Setting up leap (2.3.1+31549) ...
Leap Motion installed under /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
Failed to start leapd.service: Unit leapd.service not found.
dpkg: error processing package leap (--install):

Please follow the next steps (taken from https://forums.leapmotion.com/t/linux-install-of-sdk-fails/5158/6):

1. After the install failure, I simply uninstalled with:

sudo dpkg -r leap

2. Now, with no leap installed yet, I followed the post above and just created the file as mentioned there (I used the
terminal to write the following command, to use the nano text editor as root user):

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/leapd.service

3. I pasted that content (reproduced here for easiness):
(also please note that on Ubuntu terminal, you paste with CTRL+SHIFT+V instead of just CTRL+V)

#   systemctl daemon-reload

After=syslog.target

Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/leapd
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

4. Saved (CTRL+O then ENTER), and exited (CTRL+X)

5. Still using the terminal, executed the two commands from that same post, BUT I included the sudo prefix to run them
as root user:

sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/leapd.service /etc/systemd/system/leapd.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

6. All is right now and we can properly install. So, I just installed the original package:as in the official Leap
guide:

sudo dpkg --install Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb

(please just note that I'm using a x64 Ubuntu, so I installed the 64 bits package)

The above command should output someting similar to:

Selecting previously unselected package leap.
(Reading database ... 478480 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack Leap-2.3.1+31549-x64.deb ...
Unpacking leap (2.3.1+31549) ...

Leap Motion installed under /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
Check Leap Motion daemon with:
  service leapd status
Open the Leap Motion GUI with:
  LeapControlPanel
See /usr/share/Leap/README.linux for more information.


7. Done!!!

8. You can try to open the Leap Motion GUI

$ LeapControlPanel



Installation of the LeapMotion SDK
==================================

To install the SDK, go to: https://developer.leapmotion.com/sdk/v2 
and download the SDK (this will require you to sign up).

You can check the following link for more information on how to use the SDK in Python:
https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/index.html

You can copy-paste the following files:

- Leap.py
- LeapPython.so
- libLeap.so

in your /usr/local/lib/python<version>/dist-packages/. Or set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to where these files
are on your system.

By default, Leap only supports Python 2.7 as described here:

"The LeapPython library included in the Leap Motion SDK supports only Python 2.7. However, the SDK also includes the
SWIG interface file used to generate the LeapPython source code, so advanced users can generate and compile their own
version of LeapPython. For instructions, refer to Generating a Python 3.3.0 Wrapper with SWIG 2.0.9 in our support
knowledge base."

For more info, check the following link:
https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/devguide/Project_Setup.html


If at one point, the daemon is not running, you can run it again using:
$ sudo service leapd restart
