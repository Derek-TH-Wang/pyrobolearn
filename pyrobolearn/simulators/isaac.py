"""Define the Isaac SDK simulator API.

This is the main interface that communicates with the Isaac SDK simulator [1]. By defining this interface, it allows to
decouple the PyRoboLearn framework from the simulator.

The signature of each method defined here are inspired by [2] but in accordance with the PEP8 style guide [3].
Parts of the documentation for the methods have been copied-pasted from [2] for completeness purposes.

Dependencies in PRL:
* `pyrobolearn.simulators.simulator.Simulator`
