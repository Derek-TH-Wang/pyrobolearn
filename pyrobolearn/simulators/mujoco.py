"""Define the MuJoCo Simulator API.

This is the main interface that communicates with the MuJoCo simulator [1]. By defining this interface, it allows to
decouple the PyRoboLearn framework from the simulator. It also converts some data types to the ones required by
MuJoCo.

Warnings: The MuJoCo simulator requires a license in order to use it.
