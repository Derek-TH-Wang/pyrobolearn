class Quadcopter(RotaryWingUAV):
    r"""Quadcopter

    WARNING: Currently, in pybullet there is no air, so we simulate the thrust force.

    Based on momentum theory, we can calculate the thrust [4,5,6] to be:

    .. math::

        F &= A \Delta p = A (P_e - P_0) \\
        F &= A [(p_0 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_e^2) - (p_0 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_0^2)] \\
        F &= \frac{\rho A}{2} (v_e^2 - v_0^2)

    where :math:`\Delta p` is the difference between the pressure ahead and behind the propeller, :math:`A = \pi r^2`
    is the propeller disk area with radius :math:`r = \frac{D}{2}` and diameter :math:`D`, :math:`p_0` is the static
    pressure and :math:`\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2` is the dynamic pressure, :math:`v_0` is the velocity of the aircraft
    (aka propeller forward speed, inflow velocity, forward airspeed, or freestream velocity), and :math:`v_e` is the
    exit velocity. At the second line above, we used Bernoulli's equation to relate the pressure and velocity.

    According to [6], the dynamic thrust is given by:

    .. math:: F = \rho A [ (\frac{RPM}{60} pitch)^2 - (\frac{RPM}{60} pitch) v_0 ] (k_1 \frac{D}{pitch})^k_2

    where :math:`pitch` is the propeller pitch (i.e. the distance a propeller would move in 1 revolution if it were
    moving through a soft solid). If :math:`v_0 = 0` we have a static thrust.

    Notes:
    * From [6], "for dynamic thrust, consider the equation to be an underestimate of what the propeller is actually
        doing"
    * :math:`1 RPM = \frac{2\pi}{60} rad/s`
    * the air density :math:`\rho` is :math:`1.225kg/m^3` at sea level and at :math:`15C`.
