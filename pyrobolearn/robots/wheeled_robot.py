    "A differential wheeled robot is a mobile robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed
    on either side of the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of
    its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. To balance the robot, additional wheels or
    casters may be added." [1]
