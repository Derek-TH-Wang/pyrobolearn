"""Define the various sensors used in robotics.

This is decoupled from the robots such that sensors can be defined outside the robot class and can be selected at
run-time. This is useful for instance when a version of the robot has specific sensors while another version has
other sensors. Additionally, this is important as more realistic sensors can result in a better transfer from
simulation to reality. Also, note that some simulators are deterministic and thus the sensor class allows you to
add some noise to the returned sense value. The type of noise can also be selected at runtime.

    All sensors inherit from this class. Note that any sensors is attached to a body, link, or joint. Because these
    elements can move, the position and orientation of the sensor attached to it can change as well.
    Currently, sensors are massless (i.e. mass=0). Thus be sure that the link to which the sensor is attached, has
    the correct sensor mass / inertia.
