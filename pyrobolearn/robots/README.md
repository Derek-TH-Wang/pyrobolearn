## Robots

This folder contains the various robots that can be used in the PRL framework. Currently, they can be loaded in the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) simulator. The corresponding URDFs have been downloaded from various repositories and updated/corrected if necessary (adding inertial tags, correcting inertia values, updating collision meshes, etc). All the robots inherit from the main `Robot` class, and can be loaded in the framework using:

```python
import pyrobolearn as prl

sim = prl.simulators.Bullet()
robot = prl.robots.<RobotClass>(sim)
```

or

```python
import pyrobolearn as prl

sim = prl.simulators.Bullet()
world = prl.worlds.BasicWorld(sim)
robot = world.loadRobot(<Robot_name_or_robot_class>)
```

Here is a list of robots that I plan to add at one point (some of them require to simulate some fluid dynamics, as done in the `quadcopter` class) but can interest already some people:
- [ ] [ANYmal](https://www.anymal-research.org/): I am currently not sure if I can release the URDF of this robot, and thus I will not do it until it is officially released by ETH.
- [ ] [ROS robots](https://robots.ros.org/): I plan to provide soon the robots listed on this website (I am currently cleaning the URDFs of some of them)
- [ ] [Universal robots](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot)
- [ ] [rotors-simulator](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator)
- [ ] [uuv-simulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator)
- [ ] [usv-simulator](https://github.com/OUXT-Polaris/ros_ship_packages)

Note that currently, we load directly the URDF from the xml/urdf file using the simulator, but later we might first parse it beforehand and allow the user to add, remove, or change few links at runtime.

TODO:
- [ ] correct still few URDFs (some of them have inertia values that are too high!)
- [ ] finish to implement few methods
- [ ] move all the urdfs outside the pyrobolearn framework: put it in another repo or in a dropbox/google drive.
