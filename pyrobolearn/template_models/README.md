## Template (simplified) models

This folder contains template models such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP), Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), and other models.
These simplified models are often used in legged locomotion to understand the fundamental principles and predict the underlying locomotive behavior for a certain time horizon. Specifically, instead of using directly the robot model which often has a high number of degrees of freedom, these template models allows for a more tractable approach.

*Notes*: the code presented here still need to be cleaned and tested.
