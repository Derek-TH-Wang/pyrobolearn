    The Contact Invariant Optimization (CIO) algorithm [1] consists to minimize the following cost:

    .. math::

        s* = argmin_s L(s)
           = argmin_s L_{CI}(s) + L_{physics}(s) + L_{task}(s) + L_{hint}(s)

    where :math:`s` is the state which contains :math:`x_k`, :math:`\dot{x}_k`, and :math:`c_k` for each phase/interval
    :math:`k`. The vector :math:`x_k` contains the torso and end-effector position and orientation, while
    the :math:`c_k` vector represents the auxiliary contact variables.

    Here is what each term represents in the total cost:
    - :math:`L_{CI}` is the contact invariant cost
    - :math:`L_{physics}` penalizes physics violation
    - :math:`L_{task}` describes the task objectives (i.e. high-level goals of the movement)
    - :math:`L_{hint}` provides hints to accelerate the optimization. This term is optional.

    We now describe each cost more specifically.


    * The contact invariant cost is given by:

    .. math:: L_{CI}(s) = \sum_i^N \sum_t^T c_{i, \phi(t)} (||e_{i,t}(s)||^2 + ||\dot{e}_{i,t}(s)||^2)

    where :math:`e_{i,t} = [p_i(q_t) - n'(p), 0]` is the 4D contact-violation vector.

    * The physics violation cost is formulated as:

    .. math:: L_{physics}(s) = \sum_t^T || J_t(s)^T f_t(s) + B u_t(s) - \tau_t(s) ||^2

    where the external contact forcing terms :math:`f_t = [f_1, ..., f_N]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{6N}` (with each forcing
    term  (for each end-effector) is given by :math:`f_i = [f_c, \tau_c]` where :math:`f_c` is the translational
    contact force, and :math:`\tau_c` is the torsion around the surface normal) and joint actuation
    :math:`u_t \in \mathbb{R}^{D_a}` (where :math:`D_a` are the number of actuated joints and  are computed according to:

    .. math::

        f_t, u_t =& \arg \min_{f, u} || J_t(q_t)^\top f - Bu - \tau_t(q_t, \dot{q}_t, \ddot{q}_t)||^2 + f^\top W_t f +
            u^\top R u \\
            \mbox{subject to } \quad A f \leq b

    which is solved using quadratic programming (QP). The linear constraint is the linear approximation to the friction
    cone (i.e. the friction pyramid). The torques :math:`\tau_t(q_t, \dot{q}_t, \ddot{q}_t)` are given by the whole
    body dynamic equation:

    .. math:: \tau_t(q_t, \dot{q}_t, \ddot{q}_t) = H(q_t) \ddot{q}_t + C(q_t, \dot{q}_t) \dot{q}_t + g(q_t)


    * The task cost is expressed as:

    .. math:: L_{task}(s) = \sum_b l_b(q_T(s)) + \sum_t^T ||f_t(s)||^2 + ||u_t(s)||^2 + ||\ddot{q}_t(s)||^2

    where :math:`b` is an index over different tasks, :math:`l_b` are task specific terms which only depends on the
    final pose :math:`q_T(s)`.


    * The optional hint cost is given by:

    .. math:: L_{hint}(s) = \sum_t \max(||z_t(s) - n(z_t(s))|| - \epsilon, 0)^2

    where :math:`z_t(s) = z_t(q, \ddot{q})` is the zero-moment point (ZMP).


    The CIO consists of 3 phases:
    1. only :math:`L_{task}` is enabled
    2. All 4 terms (:math:`L_{task}`, :math:`L_{physics}`, :math:`L_{CI}`, :math:`L_{hint}`) are enabled but with
       :math:`L_{physics}` down-weighted by 0.1
    3. :math:`L_{task}`, :math:`L_{physics}`, and :math:`L_{CI}` are fully enabled

    Note that the solution obtained at the end of each phase is perturbed with small zero-mean Gaussian noise to
    break any symmetries, and used to initialize the next phase.

    From the optimized state :math:`s^*`, the optimal joints :math:`q^*` at each time step can be computed (using IK
    and cubic spline interpolation). A PD controller can then be used to move the joints to their desired configuration.

    Note that the framework does not take into account any sensory feedback.
