# PyBullet User Guide

Check the pybullet quickstart guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA

To install it, use `pip install pybullet`.

Keymaps:
* `mouse wheel`: zoom
* `left-click`: drag the robot/object in the environment
* `Ctrl + left-click`: rotate in the world
* `Ctrl + mouse wheel`: move in the world
* `Ctrl + right-click`: zoom in the world
* `w`: show the wireframe, useful to check collisions.
* `g`: open/close the left/right panels
* `s`: add/remove light
* `esc`: close the simulator


Note that you can define your own key mapping, as pybullet can return you the key/mouse event. This can be useful to play/pause/reset the simulator, and so on.
