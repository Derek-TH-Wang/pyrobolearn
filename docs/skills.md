## Skills

*Note*: this document might currently contain some errors. I will update it later.

Skills can be divided into different categories, and are ordered by increasing difficulty (from gross skills to more fine skills). The presented skills are based on [1,2,3,4,5,6], and what I could think of.

* Manipulation
    * push and pull an object
    * grasp an object
    * lift an object
    * pass an object from one hand to another.
    * strike an object (swinging a bat or stick)
    * throw an object (control direction and force progressively)
    * catch an object (follow flight of object, try to touch an object that has been thrown, catch an object with simple geometry,...)
    * stacking objects (stack cubes --> stack coins)
    * pencil tracking and handwritting
    * dribbling (with two hands, one hand, while walking,...)
    * put a piece on a chessboard (without moving the other pieces), placing some dominoes
    * dual motor skills (balance cards)
    * fold clothes

* Locomotion
    * crawl
    * stand up
    * balance (on two legs, on 1 leg)
    * jump (on two legs using a support with the hands, two legs, one leg, using a rope)
    * static locomotion
    * climb stairs
    * kick or roll (stationary ball, control direction and force progressively, dynamic ball, etc)
    * running
