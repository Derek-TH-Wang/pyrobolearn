## Robotics tutorials

This folder contains tutorials about robotics in the form of python notebooks and webpages, and are based on books, slides, videos and notes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. I hope these tutorials will be useful for people learning about robotics, and a possible supplement to their theoretical courses.


## References

Here are the main references that I used while writing the tutorials:
1. "Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control", Siciliano et al., 2010
2. [CS223A - Introduction to Robotics](https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs223a) by Prof. Khatib.
3. [Course materials](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/Teaching.php) from Prof. Alessandro De Luca

4. "Springer Handbook of Robotics", Siciliano et al., 2008

Note that each python notebook provides more accurate references.
