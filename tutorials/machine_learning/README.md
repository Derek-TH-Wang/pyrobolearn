## Tutorials about machine learning

This folder contains tutorials about different learning models and algorithms used.

## References

Prerequisites: some tutorials require the student to be familiar with multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, information theory, and other mathematical fields.

Here are references/tutorials that I have watched/read, with their corresponding level: 
1. "Machine Learning", by Prof. Andrew Ng. (Easy + practical)
2. "CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence", (Easy + theoretical/practical)
3. "Learning from Data" Yaser (Medium + theoritical)
4. "Machine Learning", by Prof. Nado de Freitas, 2013 (Medium + theoretical)
5. "Deep Learning" (www.deeplearningbook.org), Goodfellow et al., 2016 (Easy)

Are there other stuffs to learn?
Yes, probabilistic graphical models, variational inference, information geometry, etc.
