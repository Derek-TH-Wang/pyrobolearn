<h1>PyRoboLearn</h1>

<p>Abstract: "On the quest for building autonomous robots, several robot learning frameworks with different functionalities have 
  recently been developed. Yet, frameworks that combine diverse learning paradigms (such as imitation and reinforcement learning) 
  into a common place are scarce. Existing ones tend to be robot-specific, and often require time-consuming work to be used with 
  other robots. 
  Also, their architecture is often weakly structured, mainly because of a lack of modularity and flexibility. This leads users 
  to reimplement several pieces of code to integrate them into their own experimental or benchmarking work. 
  To overcome these issues, we introduce PyRoboLearn, a new Python robot learning framework that combines different learning 
  paradigms into a single framework. Our framework provides a plethora of robotic environments, learning models and algorithms. 
  PyRoboLearn is developed with a particular focus on modularity, flexibility, generality, and simplicity to favor (re)usability. 
  This is achieved by abstracting each key concept, undertaking a modular programming approach, minimizing the coupling among the 
  different modules, and favoring composition over inheritance for better flexibility. We demonstrate the different features and 
  utility of our framework through different use cases."</p>
