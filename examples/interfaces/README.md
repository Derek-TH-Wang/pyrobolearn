## Interfaces and Bridges

In this folder, you will find examples on what interfaces you can use and on how you can collect the data from them.
You will also be able to connect an interface with an element of the world (in this case, a robot) using bridges, 
and see that different bridges can lead to different behaviors while getting the data from the same interface. 

Here are few examples that depict the various interfaces available to the user:
1. `mouse_keyboard.py`: use the mouse keyboard interface
2. `webcam.py`: use the webcam interface
3. `playstation.py`: use the Playstation game controller interface
4. `xbox.py`: use the Xbox game controller interface
5. `asus_xtion.py`: use the Asus Xtion interface
6. `openpose.py`: use the Openpose interface
7. `speech.py`: use the speech (recognizer/translator) interface

**Note**: some interfaces require to install different libraries, and possibly to configure them. Check the raised errors.
