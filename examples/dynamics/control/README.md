### Force and Impedance control

In a nutshell, you have different control modes:

* position control: specify the desired task (or joint) positions
* velocity control: specify the desired task (or joint) velocities
* force control: specify the desired task (or joint) forces
* impedance control: specify the task (or joint) forces based on the desired task (or joint) positions, velocities, and accelerations.
