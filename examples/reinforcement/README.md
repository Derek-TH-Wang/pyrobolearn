In this folder, you can run reinforcement learning tasks.

- In the `gym` subfolder, you can run `gym` environments using the models and algorithms available from the PRL 
  frameworks.
- In the `baselines` subfolder, you can `PRL` environments using the neural networks models and algorithms provided by 
  the `stable_baselines` library.
- Other example files provide PRL environments along with models and algorithms provided by PRL.
