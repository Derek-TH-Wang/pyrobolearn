"""Load a basic world with different objects in it

Load a basic world (i.e. with a floor and gravity enabled) with different objects (only visual, and with collision
shapes) that are movable, fixed, or are moving. The objects with a positive mass and a collision shape can be moved
in the simulator using the mouse.

You can move in the world using the keyboard and mouse:
- `ctrl + left click`: rotate the camera
- `scroll wheel` or `ctrl + right click`: zoom in/out
- `ctrl + middle click`: move the camera
- `left click` on an object: if the object has a mass and a collision shape, you can interact with it with the mouse
- `w`: wireframe (see collision shapes)
- `g`: show/hide menu
- `esc`: quit the simulator
