This sample of code implements the "Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation" paper [1] using the PyRoboLearn framework.

We use the same factors as described in the paper; i.e. the same robotic platform, same states and actions,
same policies, same rewards (and coefficients), same learning algorithm with same hyperparameters, and so on.
