In this file, you can find the list of direct and indirect contributors to the PyRoboLearn framework. 
Personally, I think people should also acknowledge their contributions as the framework would not have 
been possible without them. However, I still need to think how this could be achieved...
If you contributed to the framework, I will automatically add you to the list and specify what you modified
/added to the framework. Just note that I won't include people who correct typos (it has to be a real contribution :p).


Direct contributors
-------------------

Leonel Rozo
No√©mie Jaquier
Daniele Bonatto
Songyan Xin


Indirect contributors
---------------------

The following list is based on the lists of contributors of the various libraries that I am using, and libraries/codes/papers that inspired parts of the framework. This list will be pretty long and as such I might have forgotten few contributors inadvertently. If you are one of them, please send me an email such that I can add you properly to the list as I try to make it as accurate as possible.

- Erwin Coumans (Bullet/PyBullet)
- Yunfei Bai (Bullet/PyBullet)
- Emanuel Todorov (MuJoCo)
- Jemin Hwangbo (RaiSim)
- Joonho Lee (RaiSim)
- Marco Hutter (RaiSim)

- Auke Ijspeert (CPG, DMP, Salamander robot)
- Sylvain Calinon (GMM/GMR)
